get static props will get us data
gray matter is useful so we npm install it
local server tested via npm run dev
get static prop can fetch API too or from database
get static prop can only work on pages no component

If ssr we use get server side props (context); this parameter is used for ssr
if we are not pre-rendering data we use csr. 
fetch means to bring from some point, if no pre-render we will just use home function and when. SWR is used in csr
same ssr and csr can be used on same page and static as well. called hybrid
Dynamic routes
if you add markdown file i.e. md it will automatically appear in local host
page static but route dynamic 
get static props was for getting content but now we are focused on routes (URL and path) and if it is also dependent on external data then we use get static paths
when we make dynamic name we use [] and it contain place holder and any value inside will replace it
Static ID will get all paths and Static props will get static posts
based on URL we have fetch data
render markdown with npm
API is created in pages
